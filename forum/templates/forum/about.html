Moreover, Anxiety can be tough for anyone to deal with, but add in the whirlwind of changes that come with adolescence,   &nbsp;and anxiety can feel like an intrusive mind hog that spends way too much time squeezing, surprising and overwhelming anyone it lands on.
  <br>
  </br>
  &nbsp;Here are though you may be having:
	  &nbsp;Negative thoughts – what-ifs, thoughts about being judged or embarrassed, small thoughts that grow into big worries.
	  &nbsp;Excessive worry about physical symptoms (that a cut might become infected, that a headache might mean brain cancer).
	  &nbsp;An anxious brain is a strong brain, and anxious thoughts can be persuasive little beasts that stick to the inside of your skull like they belong there. Write this down and stick it to your mirror, so you see it every morning when you’re getting a faceful of your gorgeous head: ‘Thoughts are thoughts. They are NOT predictions. Let them come. And then let them go.’

&nbsp;Here is how you may be feeling:
    <ul><li>-Fearful, worried, overwhelmed, out of control.</li>
  	<li>Dread, as though something bad is going to happen.</li>
  	<li>Panic that seems to come from nowhere.</li>
  	<li>Feeling separate to your physical self or your surroundings. (This is called depersonalisation and it can be driven by anxiety.)</li></ul>

<h2>What is Anxiety? </h2>

    Well Anxiety is our body’s reaction to perceived danger or important events. Anxiety is like an internal alarm system. It alerts us to danger and helps our body prepare to deal with it. For example, it allows us to jump out of the way of a speeding car. It also helps us to perform at our best, like when you are studying for that final exam last minute. Everyone experiences anxiety time to time.

<h3> What’s going on when I’m anxious? </h3>

  &nbsp;When we’re anxious it affects our thoughts, body, and behaviours. When faced with real danger, you will have worrisome thoughts focused on the danger, your body will rev up to help you deal with the danger, and you will take action either to get away from or fight the danger. So, anxiety protects you – it’s how we’ve evolved and stayed alive as a species. Without anxiety we would be extinct!

  &nbsp;We are stress time to time and it is a normal reaction to feeling pressure. While stress is merely normal, at time stress can lead to a host of problems. It can affect our physical and emotional well being.

  &nbsp;Here are some tips to make sure you are taking care of your health:

<h2 id="personality"> Personality Disorders: </h2>

&nbsp;Personality disorders are rigid, inflexible and maladaptive, causing impairment in functioning or internal distress. A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time and leads to distress or impairment.

<h2> Paranoid personality disorder </h2>

&nbsp;Paranoid personality disorder describes deeply ingrained patterns of behavior and the manner in which individuals perceive, relate to, and think about themselves and their world.Personality disorders are enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that come from the expectations of an individual's culture. They are mostly in internal distress.

<h2> Schizoid personality disorder</h2>
  &nbsp;Schizoid personality disorder is a rare disease, it only occurs in approximately less than 1 percent of the population according to the Mayo Clinic, 2013.  Individuals that are said to fit the definition for SPD have a tendency to engage in introverted activities and arrange their life in such a way that even their choices of professions require very minimal interaction with others. Someone with SPD commonly views themselves as a bystander instead of an active member in society.   &nbsp;Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.:SPD has some similarities with schizophrenia, with some common characteristics with its negative symptoms of schizophrenia; these include lack of emotion, avoidance and lack of motivation.
      <ul><li> Neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part of a family
      <li> Almost always chooses solitary activities </li>
      <li> Takes pleasure in few, if any, activities </li>
      <li> Lacks close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives
      <li>Appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others
      <li> Shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affect (emotion) </li> </ul>

<h2> Antisocial personality disorder </h2>

&nbsp;APD or Antisocial Personality Disorder is assigned to individuals who habitually and pervasively disregard or violate the rights and considerations of others without remorse. People with Antisocial Personality Disorder may be habitual criminals or manipulate and hurt others in non-criminal ways which are widely regarded as unethical, immoral, irresponsible, or in violation of social norms and expectations. Impulsive and criminal behavior is common. The term antisocial may be confusing to &nbsp;the lay public, as the more common definition outside of clinical usage is an individual who is a loner or socially isolated. The literal meaning of being antisocial is to be against society, rules, and acceptable behavior.

<h2> Histrionic personality disorder </h2>

&nbsp;Individuals with histrionic personality disorder exhibit excessive emotionality—a tendency to regard things in an emotional manner. In most aspects they are looking for ways to receive attention due to their, for better words, ‘need attention’. People with this disorder are uncomfortable or feel unappreciated when they are not the center of attention. Behaviors may include constant seeking of approval or attention, self-dramatization, theatricality, and striking self-centeredness or &nbsp;sexual seductiveness in inappropriate situations, including social, occupational, and professional relationships, beyond what is appropriate for the social context. They may be lively and dramatic and initially charm new acquaintances with their enthusiasm, apparent openness, or flirtatiousness. They may also, however, embarrass friends and acquaintances with excessive public displays of emotion, such as embracing casual acquaintances with passion, sobbing uncontrollably over minor &nbsp;setbacks, or having tantrums.



<h2 id="ocd"> OCD </h2>

&nbsp;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Consists of two parts: the ‘obsession’ and the ‘compulsion’. Obsessions are persistent, intrusive and unwanted thoughts, images or impulses (urges). Someone with OCD usually knows that that his or her obsessions are irrational, senseless, or inappropriate, but he or she is not able to control them. This causes very high degrees of anxiety.

&nbsp;Compulsions are repeated behaviours that the person performs in order to decrease the anxiety caused by the obsession. These activities vary from person to person. Some common compulsions include: counting, touching, washing and checking.

&nbsp;Obsessions tend to be thoughts, whereas compulsions are usually behaviours. Some compulsions can also be done as thoughts – such as counting. They can vary in intensity but for a diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, the obsessions and compulsions must significantly interfere with the person’s ability to live his or her life and cause a great deal of distress.

&nbsp;Obsessions and compulsions are sometimes confused with psychosis, which is incorrect. People with OCD are aware that the thoughts they are having are their own, whereas someone experiencing a delusion or hallucination (symptoms of psychosis) will think that the thoughts he or she is having are coming from someone or somewhere else. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is also not the same thing as being a perfectionist or having anxiety-decreasing rituals (like baseball players do during &nbsp;championship games). It is also usual and normal for people to check things to make sure all is okay (such as checking to make sure the door is locked or the stove is off).

<h3>Common Obsessions (Not limited to this)</h3>

&nbsp;Contamination: Obsession about being in contact with germs (e.g., by shaking hands, touching a doorknob/keyboard, etc.), leading to intense anxiety about disease/death resulting from those germs
&nbsp;Doubts: Obsession about whether or not some action was performed (e.g., door was locked; oven was turned off), leading to intense anxiety about the disastrous consequences if the action wasn’t done (e.g., house will be burgled; house will catch fire and someone will die).
&nbsp;Exactness and Order: Obsession about having things in a particular order (e.g., pencils perfectly lined up; morning routine followed in precise order), leading to intense anxiety about devastating and usually unrelated outcomes (e.g., his or her grandmother will die; the school will burn down; he or she will fail an exam) when things are moved, are not placed in a specific way, or are generally disordered.
&nbsp;Violence/Aggression: Obsession about impulses to commit a violent, aggressive, or horrible action (e.g., to hurt someone; to swear loudly in class), leading to intense anxiety about what would happen if this impulse cannot be controlled and he or she were to act on the impulse.

<h3> Compulsions</h3>
&nbsp;Compulsions are persistent, excessive, repetitive behaviours (such as checking, washing, ordering) mental acts (such as counting, praying, repeating words silently), or rituals that someone feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to a rigid set of rules he or she has created to ease anxiety. The purpose of compulsions is to prevent distress or prevent a dreaded event or situation; however the compulsions often appear unrelated or unrealistically connected to the &nbsp;obsessions they are meant to address. Because the individual often believes that others will not understand, rituals are often performed in private.

Compulsions are very difficult to resist and if the person is not able to perform the compulsion, he or she will likely feel very anxious. Performing the compulsion often provides a brief sense of relief. Unfortunately, performing a compulsion can also strengthen the obsessive thoughts, encouraging them to return. The more frequently someone performs the compulsions, the stronger the compulsions become.

<h3> Common Compulsions</h3>
&nbsp;Washing: Repeatedly washing or cleaning, often of the hands. This compulsion is often related to contamination obsessions.
&nbsp;Checking: Repeatedly checking to make sure a task was performed, such as locking the door or turning off the oven. This compulsion is often related to obsessions about doubts.
&nbsp;Ordering: Repeatedly putting things in a particular order or requiring that things have a certain symmetry. This compulsion is often related to obsessions about order and control.
&nbsp;Counting: Repeatedly counting things to reduce anxiety (e.g., floor tiles, cars in the parking lot, numbers in general). This compulsion may be related to obsessions about violence or other horrific thoughts. The individual may believe that if they count all of the items or count to a predetermined number for every thought, it will prevent the obsession from coming true.
&nbsp;Repeating Actions: Repeatedly performing a specific behaviour in order to counteract the obsession. For example, a person who has obsessions about doing something inappropriate in school may tap their desk repeatedly in an attempt to prevent the obsession from coming true.
&nbsp;Asking for Reassurance: Repeatedly asking others for reassurance that everything is okay or that he or she performed some task (e.g., turning off the oven). This compulsion often accompanies obsessions about doubts.


<h2 id="bpd">Borderline Disorder</h2>
&nbsp;Borderline personality disorder connotes the lack of a stable sense of self. Hence, without a firm identity, people with borderline personality disorder have extreme emotional instability. Teens with borderline personality disorder find everyday life hard. Indeed, they don’t know how to process emotions. Thus, they have unstable relationships with even the people that care for them the most.’
&nbsp;Teens with borderline personality disorder are unable to connect with others. Furthermore, they become isolated and desperate. Lacking a clear sense of self, they feel chaotic and stressed. Therefore, encounters and scenarios that should be relatively easy to manage become difficult.
  <br>
    </br>
Teen borderline personality disorder symptoms include the following:
<ul> <li> Extreme emotional reactions; inappropriate and disproportionate <li>
<li> Distorted or dysfunctional self-image; a damaged identity </li>
<li> Inability to connect or feel empathy for others; intense narcissism </li>
<li> A persistent fear of abandonment and rejection </li>
<li> Volatile mood changes without clear cause that are lasting </li>
<li> Substance use disorder as a coping mechanism </li>
<li> Overwhelming anxiety and worry beyond any actual risk </li>
<li> Impulsive and risky behaviors; self-destructive patterns </li>
<li> Unwarranted sexuality; acting out sexually </li>
<li> Self-harm and suicidal behavior; suicide attempts. </li> </ul>

&nbsp;The causes of borderline personality disorder are not fully understood. Without a doubt, there is a definite mix of environmental and genetic factors. Some factors may include
<br>
  </br>
Neurological Factors: BPD patients lack the neural capacity needed to inhibit negative emotions. Thus, the part of the brain that regulates emotions and controls impulses is often damaged. Hence, such damage leads to the behavioral problems and personality issues.
Traumatic History: BPD patients often have a history of childhood trauma. Often, this trauma includes physical abuse, extreme stress, and/or abandonment.

<h2 id="disassociation"> Disassociation </h2>

Despite being one of the most under recognized conditions in the US today, Depersonalization Disorders, or DPD, is thought to be prevalent in as many as 1 in 50 people in the US. With these statistics, it is the third most common disorder next to Anxiety and Depression. Why is it not diagnosed as often? Unfortunately, not many practitioners are informed of the signs, and therefore, many people are often misdiagnosed or are not provided with the right resources to really understand what they are going through. If you have any of the following symptoms, know you are not alone, and that DPD is more common in teens and young adults than you may think.

<p>Symptoms: So, what exactly is disassociation? There are a few types, all involving a change or difference in a person’s way of life: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, identity confusion, and identity alteration. All of this can severely affect daily activities to the point that it is debilitating. The different types can be described as the following:</p>

<h2> Depersonalization</h2> Depersonalization is when a person can become detached from their thoughts, or sense of self. It is commonly described as a kind of ‘out-of-body experience’, making someone feel as if they do not know who they are, doesn’t recognize self in mirror, kind of a bystander in their own body, like a passenger with no control of body, lives life as if an automation.

<h2> Derealization </h2> Derealization is when someone feels as if the world is fake/phony, foggy, distorted, and don’t feel like they are a part of it, as if they are too deep within themselves. Others around the individual seem to be unreal as well, or “lack souls.” This can be extremely terrifying, as they start to question their existence.

<h2> Dissociative Amnesia </h2> This is when people can experience periods of fogginess, or zoning out, enough that they lose track of time. They can forget how they got somewhere, or forget what they have done for most of the day.

<h2> Identity confusion/alteration </h2> Identity confusion is characterized as not knowing who you are at certain periods. People may experience personality changes, or seem like a different person in certain situations.
  <br>
  </br>
What are some of the causes:
&nbsp;DPD is usually caused by a very traumatizing event, especially chronic trauma. Trauma causes unbearable pain to a person, and if it’s significant enough, the brain can push these memories and feelings out of a specific event, therefore enacting the DPD symptoms, for example feeling numb and ‘not real,’ lifeless. It’s the brain’s way of protecting the person from the pain. This is thought to happen if the individual suffered from psychological trauma from a parent at a young age, therefore &nbsp;affecting the way a kid will react to a traumatizing/emotional experience, as well as affecting how they process their feelings and emotions.

If you have any of these symptoms, there are ways to get better (note that these aren’t a cure all)

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) : A type of therapy that is different in a way that targets your thought patterns. Typically, anyone who has DPD or other mental illnesses are prone to toxic, obsessive thought patterns that are negative and make their situation worse. CBT helps to find and identify these patterns, and in turn tries to change them to become more positive. There are many resources that offer CBT, with a new app that has this as well (app name).

<h2 id="depression"> Depression </h2>

&nbsp;A person with depression usually has a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities for more than two weeks. This change in mood represents the difference from a person's default mood. Some of the symptoms of depression are; being in a depressed mood or irritable, having a decreased interest or pleasure in activities, a significant weight difference or change in appetite, change in sleep schedule, fatigue or loss of energy, feeling guilty, the diminished ability to think or &nbsp;concentrate, and thoughts of suicide.
